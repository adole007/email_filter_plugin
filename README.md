Here is a simple example of how a DNN might be used to filter spam emails:

First, we would need to collect a large dataset of both spam and non-spam emails, and use this data to train the network.
The network would be composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, with each layer processing the input data in a different way to extract useful features and patterns.
As the network is trained, it would adjust the connections between its nodes in order to improve its ability to correctly classify the input emails.
Once the network has been trained, we can use it to classify new incoming emails as either spam or non-spam.
To do this, we would input the new email into the network and let it make a prediction based on the characteristics it has learned to associate with spam emails.
If the network predicts that the email is spam, we can take the appropriate action (such as moving it to a spam folder or deleting it altogether).
Of course, this is just a very simple example of how a DNN might be used for spam filtering. In practice, the specific details of how the network is designed and trained would depend on the particular dataset and the desired performance of the system.
